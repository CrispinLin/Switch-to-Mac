Tricky sublime operations:

from:https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/vintage-surrounding-double-quotes/2875/5

I don't know about ST2 but in ST3 brackets and parenthesis work fine by just selecting the opening bracket.

To wrap apostrophes or quotes in Vintage mode you **don't **need the Surround plugin. 
All you need to do is:

select (multi) lines in Visual mode

hit apostrophe or Shift+apostrophe (nothing appears to happen)

hit ESC

note: this technique doesn't seem to work with the Vintageous plugin. Only with the built-in Vintage mode.
